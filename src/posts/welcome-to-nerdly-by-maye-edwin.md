# Welcome to the Nerdly!

## Yet another blog?

I have been thinking of like having a quick
kinda way of writing down tiny posts of interesting things
I learn about or do daily as a web dev.

**_so, yeah! That got me here!_**

## Q1. What's the purpose of this?

**A1.** I'll be posting tiny posts about PWAs, es6, vanilla js,
jenga css, css3, semantic html and lots of firebase as well!
Very tiny technical articles!

## Q2. What happens to my main blog?

**A2.** Aaah, nothing bad's happening! Expect [more detailed and long](https://maye.pwafire.org/articles/)
technical docs and guides, dev community and tech related writings!

## Q3. Can I clone Nerdly?

**A3.** Aaah, yes! Why not? It's so easy. So, [Generate it from GitHub](https://github.com/mayeedwin/nerdly/generate) or
[Remix on Glitch](https://glitch.com/~nerdly) and follow [this guide](https://nerdly.glitch.me/posts/clone-nerdly/)
to have your [Nerdly Clone](http://nerdlyweb.web.app/).
